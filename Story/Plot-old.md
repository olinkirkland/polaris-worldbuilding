1. The Svalbard Republic's invasion of Svea begins with the Republican Army laying siege to Sveabyen. As the game begins, the Player is inside the city and escapes further south by fighting several battles against Republican troops and Svean deserters. The Player then travels toward Nordlandal. One companion (Tutorial Companion) is added to the party during the escape from Sveabyen and helps the Player learn game mechanics.

2. Player spends some time in Nordlandal helping against Wicing raiders and completing side quests. Two companions are added in this location. Soon, the Heralds are introduced as an unstoppable force attacking Nordlandal and razing it while the Player's party is left with no choice but to narrowly escape on a Wicing longboat disguised as Wicings. During the attack the Tutorial Companion is killed by the Master, allowing the Player's escape.

3. Having arrived by boat in Nybergen, the Player's party is outed as non-Wicings and are sentenced to death by combat. In a gladiatorial arena, they defeat several opponents before being officially pardoned by the impressed leader of a powerful Wicing House. The Player learns more about the Heralds and the evil Master, a telepathic being controlling the Herald army intent on conquering Svalbard. The Player can add a companion in this area. The main quest begins: saving Svalbard from the Heralds by assembling an army capable of stopping the them.

The Player sets out to Nordaustlandet to stop the weapon as allied troops prepare for a defense of Nybergen.

6. Saving Svalbard I: While the forces of good and evil clash in Nybergen, the Player sets out for Nordaustlandet where a number of atomic bombs have are being launched from a pre-war silo.
