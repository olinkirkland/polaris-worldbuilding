Overview
The main plot arc of Polaris is intended to be a vehicle for player exploration while hitting satisfying, familiar adventure-story beats along the way. While loosely based on a hero’s journey, the main goal of this template is to make the player visit and explore carefully crafted locations and feel like they have agency in the game’s setting.
The story must be composed of the following elements:
1.	A big bad enemy that needs to be defeated by the player, with the plot culminating in a grand and ultimate final conflict in which the world of Polaris is saved
2.	Interesting companions that the player can engage in dialogue to learn more about the characters’ personal histories
3.	Distinct locations to travel to with carefully crafted lore and reasons to travel to them
Setting
The eponymous setting of Polaris is a post-apocalyptic Svalbard – a region roughly the size of West Virginia. For [reasons], climate disasters and biological warfare have driven humankind to seek refuge in the far north where the primary industries keeping them alive are coal, hydroelectric energy, greenhouse farming, whaling, and fishing. Cultures are varied, though the dominant cultures are Nordic and Slavic. 
Technology comes in a small variety of shapes and sizes – most of the technology in Polaris appears in a Victorian-inspired steampunk style reminiscent of games like Dishonored or Frostpunk. However, some areas of Polaris have regressed to tribal states where “modern” technology is seldom seen. Remnant technology from “Before” is rare and coveted. Dangerous weaponry and valuable pre-war machinery can be found, usually heavily guarded by high-ranking members of the political elite.
In mainland Europe, a sprawling dominion under the control of the antagonistic Heralds – telepathic mutants bent on world domination – lays claim to the remaining free cities* on the northern coast. For [reasons], the telepaths are rumored to be assembling an army on the European mainland, preparing for an invasion of the resource-rich Polaris on an apocalyptic scale as the last holdouts are put to siege.
A variety of Polar Houses – influential noble families – vie for supremacy in Polaris, although they ultimately answer to the Kaiser of the Isles who resides in the Imperial Palace in the capital of Longyearbyen. The game starts with the archipelago in turmoil – several Polar Houses are on the brink of war, a plague has broken out in one of the island’s cities, and the Kaiser has gone mysteriously missing.
Before beginning, players choose their pronoun (he/she/they) and the way their character looks (facial hair, skin color, some simple presets). A unique origin 
*New Hanseatic League: Utrecht, Groningen, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Lubeck, Copenhagen, and Gdańsk. At the start of the story, Utrecht and Groningen have already fallen to the telepaths. 
Plot
1.	Opening: The player begins the game during a large CONFLICT with the Heralds, from which they ESCAPE. 
a.	Ideas: a battle at sea, a besieged city, an airship battle
b.	During this sequence, the player gains a TUTORIAL COMPANION, who accompanies them about 50% of the way before performing a heroic sacrifice to buy the player time to escape.
c.	The player gains an additional, permanent COMPANION who accompanies them after the TUTORIAL COMPANION dies and joins the player in their escape.
d.	The player is introduced to the Heralds during this CONFLICT, they are revealed as the primary antagonist of the story.
2.	Interlude: The player wakes up in Hamburg, dazed and confused. The COMPANION has brought them to meet a notable member of a leading Polar House, the EXPOSITION CHARACTER. They speak with their COMPANION and the EXPOSITION CHARACTER and learn that they must collect PLOT DEVICES spread out in multiple locations in order to defeat the Heralds.
a.	PLOT DEVICES are a way of uniting the various Polar Houses in order to face the Heralds. Ideas: Ancient treaties signed by the Polar Houses after the war in order to face danger, a search party to find the Kaiser to bring order to Polaris, pieces of an ancient artifact that will neutralize the Herald’s telepathic abilities
b.	The player learns that both the COMPANION and the EXPOSITION CHARACTER belong to a prestigious and unaffiliated order of warriors dedicated to protecting Polaris. They initiate the player by performing a ritual that will grant them immunity to the Herald’s telepathic powers.
c.	The EXPOSITION CHARACTER grants the player an AIRSHIP in order to journey to and collect the PLOT DEVICES. The AIRSHIP is a base location the player returns to between quests.
d.	The player is presented with five new locations. The world map and travel are enabled.
e.	The player can explore Hamburg and recruit a COMPANION.
f.	When the player collects the first PLOT DEVICE, a cutscene shows Hamburg besieged by the Heralds and it becomes inaccessible on the world map.
