Polaris takes place in a future hundreds of years after chemical and atomic warfare have left the globe desolated and global warming has affected the shape of continents and changed the fauna on land and in the sea.
Inspiration for faction design approach: "Into the Badlands"
Many people fled in the wake of the devastation forming colonies in Northern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, and even further to the Svalbard archipelago.
Several factions vie for resource dominance in the bitter north, making the best use possible of the cold land. Meanwhile, dangers lurk to the distant south in the radiated places people used to call home. The Heralds, a horde of irradiated mutants, gather...

Factions and Locations
Svalbard Republic
"From the ashes of the old, a new Republic - the rebirth of civilization."
Longyearbyen (capital), Barentsburg, and affiliated townships. Democratic republic with a mixed culture of Nordic, Slavic, and minor cultures. Known as the "Republic".
Longyearbyen (City): An economic powerhouse with a large population and a growing greenhouse industry, Longyear's capital city Longyearbyen is focused on trade and protecting its economic interests. While loyal to their government, citizens of Longyear are fickle and will opt to elect new leaders when they think things are going poorly. Behind the scenes powerful oligarchs run the government. Scientific research is conducted in the former Seed Vault by the Biology Institute, a highly secretive organization within the government. The nearby Svalbard airport has been long abandoned.
Barentsburg (City): The Republic's second-largest city, known for its coal mining and fishing industries. Barentsburg has a large Slavic population and close cultural ties to the Holy Empire. Barentsburg is located far to the southwest of Longyearbyen.
Grumant (Small Town): A town to the southwest of Longyearbyen known for its metalworking industry.
Tromsdal (Village): A village north-east of Longyearbyen known for its hunting culture and livestock farming. Hunters from Tromsdal are known to search far and wide for worthy prey and locals participate in a coming of age tradition that involves hunting and killing a radiated polar bear. This tradition is known as "Isjakt" and is tolerated by the government, but seen as needlessly dangerous.

Kingdom of Alsund
"The Kingdom will prevail." Alsund (capital) and affiliated townships. Monarchy with a mix of Nordic and Germanic cultures.
Alsund (City): A large, walled city and the namesake of the Kingdom of Alsund on the north-west of the island suffering from a deadly plague. Alsund boasts extensive defenses built to fend off attacks from Wicing raiding parties. Important industries include coal, fishing, animal husbandry, crafting, and whaling. In wake of the King's recent death, his young son has inherited the throne and the royal court has fallen into chaos as vying parties try to seize power.
Spitsburg (Town): A mountain town south of Alsund with a lead and zinc mining industry.

The Pyramid (City): "New Moscow", formerly the mining settlement of Pyramiden, The Pyramid consists of a fortified compound and three underground complexes, each one deeper than the last. The Royal Hearth (high society), The Upper Burrows (merchants and commoners), and the Lower Burrows (slums). The city is known for its powerful weapons industry selling old Soviet-era rifles and handguns and also for its large-scale coal production. A caste system keeps workers in line, though trouble is brewing in the Lower Burrows, where an uprising is beginning to form among the poorer inhabitants.
Podemley (Town): A large fishing and whaling town, walled town north of Novmoskva. Known for its trapping and valuable cold-weather clothing, styled with large fur collars.

Heralds of the Blight
"As I saw the Blight, I was enlightened." Heralds are a host of irradiated, mutated humans from the European mainland. Mutations manifest differently across the Herald population, with 99% of victims mutated into an aggressive, zombie-like state (blistered skin, decomposing from radiation, constant hunger) and the rest being granted powerful abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis, regeneration, and abnormal strength. They are led by a powerful, telephathic, deranged mutant who calls himself The Master who worships the chemical weapon that caused his mutations.
